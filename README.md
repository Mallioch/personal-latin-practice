I'm learning Latin. I'm using a combination of Wheelock, the Cambridge Latin Course, and readings from Fabulae Faciles. This project is for stimulating thoughts about random sentences to compose, with a combination of vocabulary from all three sources. This is probably not going to be useful for you.

Also, I'm not particularly good at Python.

To generate (a possibly horrible) sentence:

```
python main.py
```


To run unit tests.

```
python -m unittest discover
```
